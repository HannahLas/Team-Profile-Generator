## Module 12 Challenge with the edX Bootcamp

I completed this task for the Module 12 challenge in the edX Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development. I was tasked with creating an application that generates HTML files using input from a command-line interface. My tasks was to take the given starter code and convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. I was also provided with tests, and needed to make sure every part of my code passed each provided test. This task aimed to use the JavaScript and inquirer skills I had learned during previous weeks. I used classes to create foundations for creating employee objects. I created a parent 'Employee' class and I then created other classes which extended this employee class.  I used the inquirer module to write questions that would appear to the user in the command line.

## Usage
The user needs to navigate to the correct file directory and then type in 'node index.js.' The user then needs to answer a range of questions in the command line. A HTML file should then be created.

## Acknowledgements

I used Chat GPT to help me write the validate function. I also asked a tutor when I couldn't get the command node index.js to work. I then reinstalled an earlier version of inquirer which meant it worked and I could then create the HTML file.
